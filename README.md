# My OOP Mastery Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey in mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I focus on understanding "how things work" (The Physics) rather than just memorizing syntax.

Below is the roadmap I follow, along with a checklist of concepts I have implemented in **Java** and **Python**.

## 🧠 What I Have Learned (So Far)

### Phase 1: The Physics ⚙️
*(Understanding memory infrastructure and object creation)*
- [X] **Class vs. Object:** The difference between the blueprint and the live instance.
- [ ] **Stack vs. Heap Memory:** Where data lives in memory.
- [ ] **Reference Variables:** How we point to objects.

### Phase 2: Birth & State ✨
*(Object lifecycle and state management)*
- [ ] **Constructors:** How an object is born (Initial State).
- [ ] **The `this` Keyword:** Referencing the current object.
- [ ] **Static vs. Instance:** Shared (Class) data vs. Individual (Object) data.

### Phase 3: Security 🛡️
*(Data protection and access control)*
- [ ] **Access Modifiers:** Controlling visibility (Public, Private, Protected).
- [ ] **Encapsulation:** Hiding complexity and protecting data.
- [ ] **Getters & Setters:** Controlled access to private fields.

### Phase 4: Relationships 🤝
*(How objects interact with each other)*
- [ ] **Inheritance (IS-A):** Code reusability and hierarchy.
- [ ] **The `super` Keyword:** Accessing parent class members.
- [ ] **Composition (HAS-A):** Building complex objects from simpler ones (The better alternative?).

### Phase 5: Polymorphism 🎭
*(Flexibility and multiple forms)*
- [ ] **Method Overloading:** Static Polymorphism (Compile-time).
- [ ] **Method Overriding:** Dynamic Polymorphism (Runtime).
- [ ] **Upcasting & Downcasting:** Flexible type handling.

### Phase 6: The Architect 🏛️
*(Structure and Abstraction)*
- [ ] **Abstract Classes:** Incomplete blueprints.
- [ ] **Interfaces:** Strict contracts for classes.
- [ ] **Loose Coupling:** Reducing dependencies between classes.

### Phase 7: Professional Design 🚀
*(Advanced Design Principles)*
- [ ] **S.O.L.I.D Principles:** The 5 rules of clean OOP design.
- [ ] **Design Patterns:** Standard solutions to common problems.
